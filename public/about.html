<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Windsor with a keen interest in technology and innovation. 
  Having recently completed a co-op as an Information Technology Analyst at Entegrus in Chatham, I gained hands-on 
  experience in the field, developing problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of IT systems. My academic 
  journey has equipped me with strong technical skills, while my practical experience has reinforced my ability to 
  adapt and find solutions in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Beyond technology, I have a passion for vintage fashion, appreciating the timeless style and individuality it brings. 
  Whether hunting for unique pieces or integrating retro aesthetics into my wardrobe, I enjoy expressing creativity through 
  clothing. My love for the past blends seamlessly with my forward-thinking approach to technology, making me someone who values 
  both tradition and innovation.</p>

<p>I also find energy and teamwork in volleyball, playing in a house league where I hone my skills and enjoy the 
  competitive spirit of the game. Balancing studies, sports, and personal interests, I bring a well-rounded perspective 
  to everything I do. Whether problem-solving in tech or strategizing on the court, I thrive in collaborative settings 
  and am always eager to grow and explore new opportunities.</p>
